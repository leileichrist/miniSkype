<h2>miniSkype-a live-conference P2P streaming system</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In this final MP, we will use all the components built in previous MPs to build an online
conference P2P streaming system. Our Live-conference system enable multiple people
video chatting/conference at the same time. This video streaming is interest oriented,
double direction and bandwidth adaptation. Each user in our system is interest oriented,
as it only have video chatting with the user they are interested. The video chatting is
double direction, as the user sending and receiving video streaming simultaneously. The
most important character of our system is that itâ€™s bandwidth adaptation, it can switch
between different video modes based on the networking environment.</p>
